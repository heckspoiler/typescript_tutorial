// why do we care for arrays in typescript?

// 1. TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array
// 2. TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array
// 3. We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions
// 4. Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

// help with inference when extracting values

const car = carMakers[0]; // typescript knows that the variable "car" is a string, because it knows that the array "carMakers" only contains strings
const myCar = carMakers.pop(); // typescript knows that the variable "myCar" is a string, because it knows that the array "carMakers" only contains strings

// prevent incompatible values
carMakers.push(22); // we get an error here because we try to push a number into an array that only contains strings

// help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions

carMakers.map((car: string): string => {
  return `this is a ${car}`;
});

// flexible types

const importantDates: (string | Date | number)[] = []; // this is how a flexible array looks like. It can contain multiple different types of values. We can also use type aliases to make the code more readable.

importantDates.push(new Date());
importantDates.push('2020-10-10');
importantDates.push(100);
importantDates.push([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]); // this is an array inside an array, so it's a two dimensional array. We can also use type aliases to make the code more readable. But it doesn't work because of the annotation.

//When to use typed arrays? --> any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order
// arbitrary = willkÃ¼rlich

// Tuple --> array-like structure whre each element represents some property of a record

// object representing a drink

const drink = {
  color: 'brown',
  carbonated: true,
  sugar: 40,
};

// let's represent the object above as an array (tuple)

const pepsi: [string, boolean, number] = ['brown', true, 40];
// this is a tuple. We use a tuple when we want to represent a record with some kind of property. The order of the elements in the tuple is very important. If we change the order of the elements, we get an error.
